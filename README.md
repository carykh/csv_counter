Here's how to do it!

Put the .csv file and the .py file in the same directory. Then edit the first two lines of the .py file to have the correct info. (Correct username, correct indices for which column has the actual votes).

Then, open a command prompt from that folder (in Windows, click on the filepath, type "cmd", hit enter.) In the command prompt, type "python csv_counter.py", and BOOM it should tell you the results!
